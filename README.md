#### Requesting Icons

Sometimes it's tough to get through lists and lists of requests. To make it easier, please try to limit each new request issue to 5-6 icons. This will help me get through smaller chunks a little at a time. Of course, if you have more than 5-6, go ahead and submit multiple issues.

Please provide the following via [Github Issues](issues):
 - Bundle ID (ex: com.google.chrome.ios)
 - Attach or provide a link to the current icon design
  - Ex: In the source of https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome-web-browser-by-google/id535886823?mt=8 you can find http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple3/v4/89/04/74/890474a1-6a23-0f2d-8697-0697a14a6faa/icon175x175.png
